A bit about myself portrayed using a Macbook inspired UI and a Terminal layout.

## User guide

- Login page: You can type anything into the password field. You will then be taken to the bootup page.
- Bootup page: A loading animation will be shown for a couple of seconds. You will then be taken to a terminal page.
- Terminal: Navigate directories/files that contain info about me. Files are .txt and .png/.jpg files.

## Notes

- This "terminal" does not support all of the features offered by the traditional terminal.
- If you're not sure what commands are available, type 'help' to get a list of the available commands.
- Tab autocomplete is available for most of the commands/files.
